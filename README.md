Overview

- A snapshot of the league including popular links being shared on Twitter, leading teams and top scorers
- Team profiles that give their rank, best players, and past and upcoming game
- A generator that provides talking points either from 'mad libs' style string generation or application of a Markov Chain to refined tweets 
- User collections that can be shared to the community and upvoted by other users

The application used a range of tools including the Twitter API, Markov Chains, web scraping, along with the MVC model, validations and the Active Record ORM.
